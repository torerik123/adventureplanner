- Adventure Planner is a website for creating and sharing gear lists for all kinds of adventures. 
The main focus was to create an app for people who are planning long distance trips where packing light and saving weight is essential.
After creating a list of items, the user can see the weight distribution for each category and the total weight for all items.
